# Shravan: AI YouTube Video Processing with Speech-to-Text, Q&A, and Translation

## 📌 Overview
Shravan is an AI-powered tool designed to process YouTube videos by converting speech to text, translating transcripts, summarizing content, and enabling contextual Q&A. 
This project leverages on **Speech Recognition**, **Advance NLP**, **Hugging Face**, and **Seq2Seq LLMs** 

## ✨ Features
- 🎤 **Video-to-Audio Conversion**: Extracts audio from locally downloaded YouTube videos.
- 📝 **Speech-to-Text Transcription**: Converts audio chunks into text using PyDub and Wave2Vec.
- 🌍 **Translation Support**: Translates transcripts into a user-specified language.
